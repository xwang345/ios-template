## Templates and solutions

<br>

### WebApiCode

This folder is NOT a full working project. 

However, it has web API (network use) code that you can copy, paste, edit, and use in your own projects. 

<br>

### UIImage+Thumbnail.swift

Extension to UIImage; includes a method that will generate a thumbnail.

### Template for Core Data version 1

Built for Xcode 9.

As is, the app has one simple entity named "Example". 

Its one-and-only controller will display a list of "Example" objects. The app user can add new object by using the `+` (add) button. The list is editable, in that objects can be deleted. 

The template includes controllers *and scenes* that enable the building of an app easier, faster, and with better quality.

### Recipes version 1

There are two versions. Select the one that matches your computer's Xcode version.

Has working data model and controller code that can be used in other projects. Assumes a very simple data storage model, persisted as a plist file in the app's Documents directory. 

Use the project's "Add files to [ProjectName]..." feature. 

Add these source code files for the data model code:
* DataModelClasses.swift 
* DataModelManager.swift

Add the appropriate controller code files to meet your needs:
* ProductListBase.swift
* ProductSceneBase.swift
* ProductDetail.swift
* ProductAdd.swift
* ProductEdit.swift
* ProductAddEdit.swift

The "Recipes" app works correctly, and has more controllers than those on the list above, because they were added and configured to support the app's functionality.
